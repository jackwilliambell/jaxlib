Provides DictionaryWriter and DictionaryReader base classes for
common serialization and deserialization of python dicts, where the
dicts qualify as Base Type dictionaries. This means the dictionary
keys must be strings the and values must also be base types.

Implementations of these classes need to write the contents
of a dictionary out to a sink or read the contents of a dictionary in
from a source. How the data is serialized when written or read is up to
the implementation, as is the source and the sink.

For example, an implementation of DictionaryWriter might use the Python
JSON module to convert the data to a string and then write the string
out to a file, with a matching implementation of DictionaryReader that
reverses this process.

Conversely, implementations of DictionaryWriter and DictionaryReader may
store the data in a database, send the data over a network, or do anything
else matching the pattern. Implementations are also free to:

1. Interpret the hints any way they like (for example, a file name to write
to/read from)

2. Filter/change the data (for example, not serialize a known value or add
a timestamp)

3. Throw an exception based on the data contents.

Also provided are the following DictionaryWriter and DictionaryReader
implementations:

* EvalStringWriter/Reader - serialize to/from a string using
ast.literal_eval()/str(); has the same limitations as ast.literal_eval()

* EvalFileDictWriter/Reader â€“ serialize to/from a file using
ast.literal_eval()/str(); has the same limitations as ast.literal_eval()
