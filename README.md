_jaxtools_ is a module containing an eclectic set of Python objects and functions which I can use in just about every Python project. You can use it as well, but your mileage may vary.

# Requirements

_jaxtools_ has no external requirements. It was originally created with Python 2, but most later developement used Python 3. While some portions of _jaxtools_ may work with Python 2, no effort has been made to make it compatible.

# Status

At this time _jaxtools_ is not ready for prime time or even taking a quick look at. So go away until this notice disappears.
 
 _jaxtools_ being actively worked on to use with another project. I am currently moving over bits of code from an earlier version of *jaxtools* and from other modules and refactoring them for consistency and better coding practices. 
 
 ## TODO
 
 * Get basics working with some tests and tag with version 0.1
 
 * Set up for and upload to Pypi
