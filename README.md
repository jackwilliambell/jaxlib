*jaxtools* is a module containing an eclectic set of Python objects and functions which I can use in just about every Python project. You can use it as well, but your mileage may vary.a

# Requirements

*jaxtools* has no external requirements. It was originally created with Python 2, but most later developement used Python 3. While some portions of *jaxtools* may work with Python 2, no effort has been made to make it compatible.

# Status

At this time *jaxtools* is not ready for prime time or even taking a quick look at. So go away until this notice disappears.
 
 *jaxtools* being actively worked on to use with another project. I am currently moving over bits of code from an earlier version of *jaxtools* and from other modules and refactoring them for consistency and better coding practices.
